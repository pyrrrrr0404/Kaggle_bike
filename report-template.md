# Report: Predict Bike Sharing Demand with AutoGluon Solution
#### Yaoru Robert Peng

## Initial Training
### What did you realize when you tried to submit your predictions? What changes were needed to the output of the predictor to submit your results?
I need to process the data so that there are no negative values, and I also need to change it to a csv file.

### What was the top ranked model that performed?
The best score I got is 0.45901, compared to 0.33756 the best one on the leaderboard.

## Exploratory data analysis and feature creation
### What did the exploratory analysis find and how did you add additional features?
I found the count will concentrate on hours between 9-21, therefore I set a new feature called "dummy" to show whether it is day or night (less uses); also, I split the datetime column to year, month, day, and hour.

### How much better did your model preform after adding additional features and why do you think that is?
Those features make the model perform much better, 1.8 compared to 0.46; a dramatic change after adding those features, I think it's because the hour and dummy feature could more precisely predict the demand (more reasonable to have higher demand during the day time).

## Hyper parameter tuning
### How much better did your model preform after trying different hyper parameters?
A little better, 0.459 compared to 0.46

### If you were given more time with this dataset, where do you think you would spend more time?
I will try to develop more useful features and also set the training time longer so that I might get a better model performance.

### Create a table with the models you ran, the hyperparameters modified, and the kaggle score.

model	hpo1	hpo2	hpo3	score
0	initial	1	random	default	1.82553
1	add_features	1	random	default	0.46155
2	hpo	5	auto	local	0.45901

### Create a line plot showing the top model score for the three (or more) training runs during the project.

## Summary
TODO: Add your explanation

Train scores use R_square for evaluation, while test scores apply the scores generated by Kaggle.
